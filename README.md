# TornadoAndElectron
System for communicate server with client 

#My task

implement a client-server interaction model. The server must be implemented using **Tornado Web Server**, and the client on **Electron.js**.

I decided to use the json format to send a short message from the server to the client

Also, the whole process is started using a bat file
